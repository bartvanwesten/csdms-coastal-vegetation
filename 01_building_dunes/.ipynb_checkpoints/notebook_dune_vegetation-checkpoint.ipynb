    "The main objective of this notebook is to provide insight into how vegetation can help in building dunes and providing added value to people living along the coast. Throughout this notebook, we'll explore how to implement the influence and growth of vegetation in a simple manner. With the produced results, we hope to answer the following questions:\n",

    "## Case study: Building a dune!\n",
    "\n",
    "Our case study focuses on a house located along a beach. Currently, the only barrier between the house and the ocean is the beach itself. Consequently, the homeowner faces nuisances from blown sand and a lack of protection against flooding during extreme hydrodynamic events.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, the homeowner wishes to establish a dune or sand buffer in front of the house, without obstructing the sea view. Several design alternatives are available for creating such a dune. The evaluation will be based on three scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Benchmark:** No sand-capturing implementation.\n",
    "2. **Sand Fences:** A cheap but static solution.\n",
    "3. **Vegetation:** A dynamic approach.\n",

    "## Method: Coupling custom Python functions with an existing aeolian model\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a simple semi-2D AeoLiS model of the coastal profile to describe the onshore aeolian flux and investigate how different solutions could affect these fluxes. The AeoLiS model is used as a basis for the computation of the supply-limited onshore transport from the intertidal area and beach towards the dune and house. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of designs is done using linking custom Python functions to AeoLiS using BMI. This way, we can 1) showcase the relative biophysical interactions between vegetation and morphodynamics, and 2) demonstrate how to implement relatively simple functions to a numerical model without having to touch the source code.\n",
